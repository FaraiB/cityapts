# cityapts

A simple site to access properties in a real estate agent's catalogue

The site was created using CSS, HTML and JavaScript. Express was used for routing and EJS for integration with the locally created API endpoint.

To run,open the terminal and navigate to the src folder and start the server:

`server: node server.js`

Next start the site in a seperate terminal:

`node index.js`
